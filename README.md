# Motivational Meme Generator

## Overview
Meme Generator Project for Udacity Intermediate Python Nanodegree. 

## Setup Instructions

**Create Virtual Environment**

Create virtual environment called .venv by issuing the following command at the terminal. Navigate to the project folder called Meme-Generator and then open a terminal session. Issue the following command.

```bash
$ python -m venv --copies .venv
```

This command creates a new virtual environment for your project.  If you are using an IDE such as PyCharm then update the project interpreter settings to point to the pythonw.exe file located in the Scripts sub-folder in the .venv directory. Note that the Python sys.path has been updated to reflect the new .venv folder site-packages folder for Python modules to reference.
